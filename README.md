# Initial Setup

1. Install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Run `install.bat` *(`install.sh` on macOS)*. This will install all dependencies required to run.
3. Run `start.bat` *(`start.sh` on macOS)*. This will start a local web server, which is required to run the sim.

You're all set. Enjoy!

Many thanks for using our simulator! We hope you like it.
